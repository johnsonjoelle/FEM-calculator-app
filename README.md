## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery

### What I learned

This was my first time using sessionStorage as opposed to localStorage.

It was also interesting figuring out a way to perform calculations for a mathematical function entered by the user. I'm not sure if my solution is the most elegant, but it works well and follows the rule of BOMDAS. This was definitely a fun challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Styling Cross-Browser Compatible Range Inputs with CSS by Daniel Stern](https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/) - This is a great article which helped me understand how to do a custom style for range input elements.
